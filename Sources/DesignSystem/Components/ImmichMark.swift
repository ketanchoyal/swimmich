// MARK: - ImmichMark
//
// The app's mark: a lens. A barrel band cut into five arcs, five iris slits,
// and an opening whose *negative space* is the petal motif — five rounded
// lobes with crisp valleys. It is the family the mark lives in (five-fold
// rotation, five colours, photography) without being anyone's flower: the
// petals are a pupil, the colour is one sweep, and the blades are cut where the
// petal valleys meet the barrel.
//
// Every contour is a formula — circles, radial wedges, and one sampled polar
// curve — not traced data, so the mark is retuned by editing the numbers in
// `ImmichMarkGeometry` and nothing else. No Apple asset, no upstream logo, and
// nothing that has to be licensed: the shape is ours, and the palette is
// `ImmichLogoColors`.
//
// Read it at the two sizes it ships at: 24 pt beside the wordmark in
// `ImmichLogo` (the app bar of eight screens) and 40 pt in the onboarding
// badge. The barrel and the slits fade below 40 pt — deliberately: at 24 pt the
// mark is a disc with a petal-shaped pupil, which is legible; the blades appear
// as it grows, which is what keeps the 1024 pt icon interesting.

/// The mark's geometry, in units of the disc's radius.
