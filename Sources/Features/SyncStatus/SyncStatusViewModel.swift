/// owner per process (`UploadViewModel` — a second `BackupEngine` would fight
/// for the Live Activity and, worse, report an empty queue while the real run
/// is in flight), and the offline index has a single writer
/// (`OfflineDownloadViewModel` over the process-wide store). Every property
/// below is therefore a *projection* of one of those two view models, read at

/// The actions are delegated the same way: each one is sent to the view model
/// that owns the state, never re-implemented here.
