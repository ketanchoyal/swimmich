/// "Haptic Feedback: off" must silence all of them — 29 modifiers across 15
/// files. Replacing each with an `if` would be 29 conditions to keep in sync
/// (and one forgotten call site is a setting that half works), so the switch
/// lives in one `ViewModifier` that renders `nil` instead of the feedback:
/// the SDK's `sensoryFeedback(trigger:_:)` takes a closure returning
/// `SensoryFeedback?`, and `nil` suppresses the response while the view keeps
/// declaring its intent.
///
/// `defaultValue = true` is what makes the gate safe outside the root tree
/// (Xcode previews, views built in isolation): without it, reading an absent
/// environment value would trap.
