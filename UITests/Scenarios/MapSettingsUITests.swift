/// End-to-end scenario for the map settings sheet (gap G14b) — the time range
/// of the map filter, and the map reachable from the photo viewer.
///
/// It drives the real app: onboarding → SSO → the Photos timeline → the Search
/// tab → the Map segment → the settings sheet → the viewer's info panel. And it
/// asserts on the WIRE what each state asked for, which is the point of the
/// card: the time range of the map travels on `GET /api/map/markers` ALONE
/// (`fileCreatedAfter` … `fileCreatedBefore`) — the timeline's
/// `/api/timeline/buckets` takes no date parameter, and `takenAfter`/`takenBefore`
/// live on the metadata *search* route, which answers assets, not markers. A map
/// that looks right while asking the wrong question is the bug this catches.
///
/// Three claims are load-bearing:
///
/// 1. **A custom range reaches the query.** After the sheet's "Use custom date
///    range" is applied, the next marker request carries BOTH bounds — a preset
///    would carry `fileCreatedAfter` only, so the second bound is what proves a
///    custom window was posed.
/// 2. **An inverted range never reaches the network.** "After" set later than
///    "Before" shows `mapSettingsRangeError`, leaves Done disabled, and the
///    marker-request count does not move — the sheet refuses the filter instead
///    of writing an empty answer under a legitimate-looking cache key.
/// 3. **Changing the filter re-asks.** Favourites on top of the range produces a
///    SECOND request with a different query, and the stub answers it with a
///    different city (`Favtown`): the marker cache gained a per-filter variant,
///    so the previous filter's payload is neither replayed nor reused.
///
/// Run it with the launcher, never by hand (it owns the slot's simulator,
/// DerivedData and stub port, and refuses a scenario that skipped itself). The
/// slot device is shared and the app caches markers on disk per filter variant,
/// so the run MUST start from a wiped device — otherwise a previous run's
/// `markers.json` serves the first map and claim 1 has no request to read:
///
///     .omp/orchestration/uitest.sh <worktree> /tmp/map-settings.uitest.log \
///         UITests/stubs/immich_stub_map_settings.py MapSettingsUITests/test_mapSettings --erase
///
/// The stub inherits `immich_stub_base` (OAuth handshake, server config, user,
/// ordinary timeline, real PNG thumbnails) and adds the two routes the feature
/// owns; see its docstring. Its one payload per filter shape is what makes the
