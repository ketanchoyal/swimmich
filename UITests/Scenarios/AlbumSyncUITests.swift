/// End-to-end scenario for the album mirror (gap G2) — the one-way
/// device-album → server-album sync `BackupEngine` drives during a backup run,
/// plus its catch-up action "Reorganize into album".
///
/// WHAT THE CARD PROMISES, AND WHAT THIS SCENARIO CAN REACH
///
/// The mirror's whole observable effect is a request to `/api/albums` (the list
/// and the create) or to `/api/albums/{id}/assets` (the write that files an
/// asset into it). Both are driven by ONE setting: `BackupSettings
/// .syncedAlbumIDs`, filled from the "Mirror into albums" picker. The reachable
/// half in a simulator is the OFF half, and it is the one that protects an
/// existing user — default empty, no behaviour change:
///
///  1. the Backup screen's Albums section carries the mirror row, and with
///     nothing chosen it says "None" (the explicit empty selection);
///  2. the mirror picker opens and shows its EMPTY STATE in words — a blank
///     `List` would read as a loading failure. (Smart albums are filtered out
///     at the call site: the resolution ignores them, so offering them would be
///     a setting with no effect. This scenario also shows the SAME library HAS
///     an album — the seeded video's smart album — which is what makes the
///     empty mirror picker an exclusion rather than a broken enumeration: the
///     scope picker, built from the same `vm.albums`, lists it.)
///  3. a FULL backup run, which really talks to the server (a dedup
///     `bulk-upload-check` and an upload per accepted asset) and really fills
///     the ledger, never touches the album API. `GET /api/albums` is not "not
///     called yet" — it is not called by a run that had every opportunity to;
///  4. "Reorganize into album" — the catch-up that recovers a ledger's server
///     ids with a `bulk-upload-check` and then writes them into the mirrored
///     albums — is guarded by `canReorganize`. After that run the ledger half
///     is satisfied on the wire and the button is STILL disabled: the album
///     half is what blocks it, so the catch-up cannot fire without a mirrored
///     album.
///
/// WHAT IS OUT OF REACH, AND SAID PLAINLY
///
/// The ON half needs a device album in `PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections
/// (with: .album, ...)` — a USER album. A simulator cannot be given one: `simctl
/// addmedia` fills the camera roll (and its smart albums), never a user album,
/// and neither the app nor any command in this harness can create one. So the
/// path "an album is picked → the mirror lists/creates server albums → the run
/// files each uploaded asset", and with it the positive `GET /api/albums`, stays
/// a MANUAL check on a device with a real album. Faking it (writing
/// `photoBackupSyncedAlbums` by hand, or a stub album for an id Photos does not
/// have) would prove nothing: the resolution matches on device ids the engine
/// reads from Photos, so a fabricated selection resolves to an empty map and the
/// assertion would pass without the feature.
///
/// THE ONE `Sources/` CHANGE THIS BRANCH CARRIES
///
/// `AlbumPickerView` (in `Sources/Features/Upload/UploadViewModel.swift`) drew a
/// blank `List` when it had no album to offer — the mirror picker on a library
/// with no user album, which is every simulator run AND a real user's first
/// launch. It now has an explicit empty state carrying the identifier
/// `albumPickerEmptyState`, which is what step 2 asserts. Additive: with albums
/// the screen is the same `List` it always was, and the wording reuses the
/// catalogue's existing "No albums yet" key, so no translation was added.
///
/// HOW TO RUN IT (all three options are required)
///
