/// watch the avatar switch to the photo the server just published, survive a

/// it (`DELETE /api/users/profile-image`) and fall back to the initials.

/// `--erase` and `--media` are not decoration: the scenario asserts the crop
/// square opens at 75 % of the image width, which is only true for the 4:3 photo
/// it seeds, and a shared device would otherwise hand the picker a library full of
/// whatever the previous run (or a neighbour) left there. The seeded file has to
/// be generated, with four colours and an off-centre disc, so that a screenshot
/// can tell "the square moved" and "the avatar now shows the upload" apart.
///
/// What the WIRE proves, route by route (the stub parses the multipart part, it
/// does not merely count the request — see its docstring):
///
/// * `GET /api/users/me` — the screen reads the identity from the server.
/// * `POST /api/users/profile-image` — one part, field `file` (never
///   `assetData`), filename `profile.jpg`, part type `image/jpeg`, a real JFIF
///   JPEG inside, framed as a closed multipart body.
/// * `GET /api/users/{id}/profile-image?v=<stamp>` — the avatar fetched the photo
///   the upload just published; the cache-buster is what stops `ImageCache` from
///   reserving the previous (or absent) one.
/// * a refused second upload publishes nothing: two POSTs, one 201, and every
///   profile-image read still carries the FIRST stamp.
/// * `DELETE /api/users/profile-image` — exactly one, only after the confirmation
///   dialog, and no profile-image read follows it (the avatar has nothing left).
