/// End-to-end scenario for "Free Up Space" (gap G1) — the batch's one
/// DESTRUCTIVE feature, and the only scenario here whose failure mode is losing
/// a photo rather than painting a wrong pixel.
///
/// The feature removes local originals that Immich already holds. Its safety
/// property is not "the screen shows a number": it is that the set of files it
/// offers is the intersection of
///
///   * what this device has (a `PHAsset` walk), and
///   * what the SERVER has CONFIRMED it has (`bulk-upload-check` → `reject`).
///
/// The ledger alone knows only what was uploaded once — an asset deleted
/// server-side stays in it — so a scan reading the ledger would offer an asset
/// whose only remaining copy is on the device, and deleting it would destroy the
/// last copy. That is the bug this scenario is built to catch, and the fixture
/// is built to make it reachable:
///
///   1. two photos are seeded into the slot's library (`--erase --media`, the
///      media dated 2020 so a past cutoff can reach them),
///   2. the app backs them up for real — both upload — so its ledger tracks two
///      assets with two checksums,
///   3. `GET /control/held` then tells the stub to hold only ONE of the two:
///      the other stands for "gone server-side since the backup",
///   4. the scan must therefore offer exactly one asset — the confirmed one —
///      and must refuse to offer the other, ever.
///
/// The library is NOT just the two seeded photos: an erased device ships its own
/// sample photos, which this run backs up as well (measured). Everything below
/// is therefore derived from the wire — which assets were uploaded, with which
/// creation dates — and never from an expected total.
///
/// Both halves are asserted: the screen (which asset the review lists, by its
/// own identifier) and the wire (which asset the server was asked about, and the
/// deletion that never goes to the server at all).
///
/// Run it with the launcher, never by hand (it owns the slot's simulator,
/// DerivedData and stub port, and refuses a scenario that skipped itself):
///
///     .omp/orchestration/uitest.sh <worktree> /tmp/free-up-space.uitest.log \

///         FreeUpSpaceUITests/test_freeUpSpace \
///         --erase --media /tmp/media-a.png --media /tmp/media-b.png

/// `--erase` is required, not a convenience: the scenario counts what is on the
/// device, and a shared slot keeps its Photos library, its defaults and its
/// ledger from every previous run.
