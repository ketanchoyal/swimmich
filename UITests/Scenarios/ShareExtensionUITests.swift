/// End-to-end scenario for the share extension (gap G21).
///
/// It drives the REAL system share sheet, from a real Photos library, into the
/// extension's own process — the only place where the feature is a feature:
/// another process reads the app's session out of the shared keychain, stages
/// the attachment the host app handed it, uploads it to `POST /api/assets` and
/// files it in the chosen album.
///
/// Three things make this scenario worth its runtime, and each of them is an
/// assertion below:
///
/// 1. THE SESSION CROSSES THE PROCESS BOUNDARY. The app signs in against the
///    stub (that is what `AuthViewModel.publishWidgetSession()` mirrors into the
///    shared keychain group), the extension then shows `Stub User · 127.0.0.1`
///    — a label only the keychain item can produce. A share sheet that read
///    nothing would show its signed-out screen instead.
/// 2. THE WIRE CARRIES THE UPLOAD, FROM THE EXTENSION. The app is TERMINATED
///    before Photos is opened, and every request asserted here is dated after
///    that point: the baseline index into the stub's log is what turns "a POST
///    arrived" into "the extension sent it".
/// 3. THE BODY IS THE REAL MULTIPART. The stub parses the parts it received and
///    answers them in `/__requests`: a sheet that sent an empty body, the wrong
///    part name or no Bearer would still paint a green row while uploading
///    nothing a real server could store.
///
/// Run it with the launcher, never by hand (it owns the slot's simulator, stub
/// port and DerivedData, and refuses a scenario that skipped itself):
///
