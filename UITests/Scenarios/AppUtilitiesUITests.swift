/// End-to-end scenario for the three diagnostic instruments of the "Me" hub's
/// Advanced section (gap G24) — **App Logs**, **Media Stats**, **Download
/// Info** — and for the one thing a log screen must never do: carry a secret.
///
/// It drives the real app: onboarding → SSO → the timeline (traffic), then the
/// hub, whose Advanced section must expose its three rows. Every instrument is
/// then asserted on BOTH surfaces — the screen and the wire:
///
/// * App Logs lists the requests THIS run made (the timeline's day call, whose
///   query the transport keeps on the wire and must NOT keep in the entry), its
///   free-text filter finds one of them, its level filter partitions the list,
///   and its export is real text.
/// * No line it renders — nor its export — contains the access token the stub
///   handed the app. The stub notes that the token really was presented as an
///   `Authorization: Bearer …` header, so the scan cannot pass by the credential
///   being absent from the session.
/// * Media Stats shows the counters `GET /api/server/statistics` served (values
///   that exist nowhere else) plus the ledger's local half, and its `severe`
///   line reaches the log only after the stub is armed to fail that route (a 5xx
///   is the one outcome the transport maps to `severe`).
/// * Download Info, empty, says so: zero files, the empty-state copy, no purge —
///   and it asks the server for nothing.
///
/// Run it with the launcher, never by hand (it owns the slot's simulator,
/// DerivedData and stub port, refuses a scenario that skipped itself, and states
