/// End-to-end scenario for the person-birthday editor (gap G15): the fifth
/// action button of a person card opens a date sheet whose Save and Clear both
/// write through ONE route, `PUT /api/people/{id}`.
///
/// It drives the real app (onboarding → SSO → Me hub → People → a person) and
/// asserts on BOTH surfaces, because a screen cannot tell the three write
/// shapes apart: set, erase, and the silent do-nothing this card was raised for
/// (`PersonUpdateDto(birthDate: nil)` omits the key instead of sending an
/// explicit `null`, so the server has nothing to update). The body of every
/// write is therefore read back from the stub, and the stub deliberately
/// answers a DIFFERENT day than the one it received — the header must show the
/// server's answer, not the draft the sheet held.
///
/// Run it with the launcher, never by hand (it owns the slot's simulator,
/// DerivedData and stub port, and refuses a scenario that skipped itself):
///
///     .omp/orchestration/uitest.sh <worktree> /tmp/person-birthday.uitest.log \
///         UITests/stubs/immich_stub_person_birthday.py \
///         PersonBirthdayUITests/test_personBirthday --erase
///
/// `--erase` is not optional here: the scenario asserts a FIRST launch (the
/// onboarding walk only exists on a device with no persisted session) and the
/// device is shared with every other scenario of the wave.
///
/// NOT PROVEN, and worth saying:
///
/// 1. The day CELLS of the graphical `DatePicker` are never tapped or moved —
///    their labels are localized ("Saturday, May 12" / "Samstag, 12. Mai"), so a
///    selector for one is a bet on the simulator's language. The draft the picker
///    holds is exercised end to end (it reaches the wire as a date-only string,
///    and the day that comes back is the server's), but "the user moved the
///    picker to another day" is asserted nowhere.
///
/// 2. BLOCKER — entering the drill-down does not work under XCUITest here. A row
///    of the people list is a `NavigationLink(value:)`, and no synthesized
///    gesture activates it: two app-level coordinate touches, an AX tap and a
///    0.4 s press per round, eight rounds across two list instances (before and
///    after a relaunch), row hittable at a sane frame, screens unmoved. A
///    CONTROL tap on the same screen — the list's own refresh button,
///    `arrow.clockwise` — does reach the app and puts a `GET /api/people` on the
///    wire, so the screen is not deaf: the row is inert. Removing the row's
///    `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` changes nothing (measured), so
///    it is not that either. Runs of 2026-09-15 reached the card TWICE before the
///    blocker became systematic (see the wire assertion below), which is when the
///    whole birthday contract was proven: `{"birthDate":"1990-05-12"}` on Save —
///    that single key, nothing else — the header then showing the day the SERVER
///    answered (`2001`), and `{"birthDate":null}` on Clear with the line gone.
///    Everything past the list — the person without a birthday, the refused write
///    and the list's error row — is written but unreached.
