"""Immich API stub for the detected-text scenario (`OcrTextUITests`, gap G8).

Thin on purpose: `immich_stub_base` already serves the OAuth handshake, the
server config, `/api/users/me`, a day of timeline and real PNG thumbnails. This
file adds the three things the feature under test owns.

1. `GET /api/assets/{id}/ocr` — an ARRAY of boxes whose eight coordinates are
   the four CORNERS of a tilted quadrilateral (`x1`/`y1` top-left, `x2`/`y2`
   top-right, `x3`/`y3` bottom-right, `x4`/`y4` bottom-left), normalized 0–1 on
   the stored image: an axis-aligned rect could not be told from the real
   contract, so every quad here is visibly tilted. The array is deliberately
   NOT in reading order and carries one box under the client's display
   threshold (`textScore < 0.5`) — the app must sort, label only the confident
   boxes, and still draw all three.

   THREE assets, because the negative half is the interesting one:

   * `TEXT_ASSET` (the shell's first timeline photo) — two confident boxes plus
     the faint one,
   * `BLANK_ASSET` (the shell's second) — an EMPTY array: the viewer must say
     so, not draw an empty overlay,
   * `SEARCH_ASSET` — a detected text the timeline does NOT contain, so a tile
     that appears on the search screen can only come from the search response
     (the Photos tab stays in the accessibility tree behind the Search tab,
     and its tiles would answer `assetTile_<id>` queries too).

2. `POST /api/search/metadata` — the v3.2.0 structured filter is the only field
   a detected-text criterion travels in (`filter.ocr.matches`); the deprecated
   scalar `MetadataSearchDto.ocr` must never appear. A body carrying the filter
   gets the assets whose detected text contains the needle, a plain free-text
   body gets nothing: the two shapes are distinguishable on screen AND on the
   wire, and both are logged on `/__requests`.

3. `GET /api/server/version` — overridden to 3.2.0 on purpose. The whole OCR
   half of the search screen is gated on the structured shape
   (`SearchViewModel.supportsStructuredSearch`), and the shell's own `1.119.0`
   would leave the toolbar toggle disabled: a scenario against it would prove
   nothing about the criterion.
