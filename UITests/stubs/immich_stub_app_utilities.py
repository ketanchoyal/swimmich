"""Immich API stub for the "app utilities" scenario (`AppUtilitiesUITests`).

Thin on purpose: everything the app needs to boot, sign in and draw a grid comes
from `immich_stub_base` (the OAuth handshake, the server config, `/api/users/me`,
a day of timeline, real PNG thumbnails). This file adds the one route the
instruments under test read, and the two controls the scenario needs to make the
log prove something:

    python3 UITests/stubs/immich_stub_app_utilities.py 8421

    .omp/orchestration/uitest.sh <worktree> /tmp/app-utilities.uitest.log \\
        UITests/stubs/immich_stub_app_utilities.py AppUtilitiesUITests/test_appUtilities

THREE ADDITIONS, EACH CARRYING ONE ASSERTION

* `POST /api/oauth/callback` hands the app a RECOGNISABLE access token. The
  scenario scans every line the log screen and its export render for that
  literal. The credential really is in flight — the app presents it as
  `Authorization: Bearer …`, and the boolean `bearerMatches` below is that proof
  noted on the wire, never the token itself, so the stub keeps no copy either.
  A diagnostic surface that showed it would be the leak the card's AC-5248
  forbids.
* `GET /api/server/statistics` answers counters that exist nowhere else (4242
  photos, 7317 videos, a 5 GiB quota): a Media Stats screen showing them read the
  wire rather than printing a plausible constant.
* `GET /control/statistics?fail=1|0` arms a 500 on the route above, and that is
  the only way to get a second LEVEL into the log without inventing one: the
  transport maps a 5xx to `severe` (`entry(for:)`), so the level filter's
  assertion has a line that only that outcome can produce.

The control route is NOT under `/__`: the shell answers every `/__…` path itself
before the feature router is consulted (`StubHandler._dispatch`), so a feature
cannot register a control route there. It is logged like any other request and
lives outside `/api/`, where the shell's fallbacks cannot swallow it.
