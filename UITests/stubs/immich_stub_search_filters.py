"""Immich API stub for the "search-filters" scenario (`SearchFiltersUITests`).

This stub exists for ONE reason: `POST /api/search/metadata` speaks two
languages, and which one the app must use depends on the SERVER GENERATION —
a fact only a stub can control. The app asks `/api/server/version` and then
sends either the v3.2.0 structured body (`filter` / `orderBy` / `cursor`) or the
deprecated flat one (`city`, `rating`, `page`, …). The two are mutually
exclusive: one body carries one of the two groups, never a mix (v3.2.0's
`withShapeExclusivity` answers 400). So this stub:

* serves `/api/server/version` from a value the scenario sets
  (`/__version?major=3&minor=2`), because the whole scenario is "the same filter,
  two generations, two bodies";
* ANSWERS the body the way the body asked to be answered: the structured shape
  gets `nextCursor` and never `nextPage`, the flat one gets `nextPage` and never
  a cursor. A stub that answered both would let a scenario pass while the app
  mixed the two languages;
* REFUSES a mixed body with the server's own 400, so the rule the scenario
  asserts on the wire is also the rule the stub enforces.

Everything else — the OAuth handshake, the server config, the user, the
timeline day, the real PNG thumbnails — comes from `immich_stub_base`.

WHY `/__version` IS GRAFTED RATHER THAN REGISTERED
    The shell answers every `/__…` path itself, before the router is consulted
    (`StubHandler._control`), so a feature route on `/__version` would never be
    reached — and the shell is a committed file shared by every scenario of the
    wave, which a feature stub must not edit. The one control route this feature
    owns is therefore wrapped around the shell's own, below. Consequence: a
    scenario sets the generation with `GET /__version?major=3&minor=2`, and
    `/__reset` puts it back to the generation the shell serves (`1.119.0`).
