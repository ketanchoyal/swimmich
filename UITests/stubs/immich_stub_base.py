"""Shared shell of the committed XCUITest stubs (`UITests/stubs/*.py`).

WHAT THIS SERVES
    The half of an Immich stub that every end-to-end scenario needs and none of
    them owns: the OAuth handshake that walks the real app from onboarding to
    the authenticated shell (`/api/oauth/authorize` → a provider page →
    `/api/oauth/callback`), the server configuration and version it reads on the
    way, the current user, one day of timeline (`/api/timeline/buckets` +
    `/api/timeline/bucket`), the asset routes (`/api/assets/{id}`, `/thumbnail`,
    `/original`) with REAL image bytes, and the introspection routes
    (`/__requests`, `/__reset`, `/__provider`, `/__whoami`) the scenarios assert
    against.

WHY `/__whoami` EXISTS
    A launcher that started a stub on a port can end up talking to someone
    else's server: an orphaned stub from an earlier session answers
    `/api/server/ping` exactly as happily, and a scenario served by the WRONG
    stub is a false green (measured: a two-hour-old `immich_stub_offline.py`
    squatting a slot port kept the timeline rendering with another feature's
    photos). `/__whoami` answers `{port, pid, stub}`; `.omp/orchestration/uitest.sh`
    refuses to run unless the port matches the one it asked for.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
    Not a feature. No `/api/memories`, `/api/albums`, `/api/stacks`, `/api/search`
    route lives here — a stub that added one would silently answer another
    scenario's requests. A feature declares its own routes (below), and an
    unrouted `/api/…` read answers `[]` so the app's unrelated list screens keep
    rendering.

HOW A FEATURE STUB USES IT (copy this skeleton)

    # UITests/stubs/immich_stub_<feature>.py
    from immich_stub_base import Response, STATE, router, main

    @router.get("/api/things")
    def list_things(req):
        return Response([{"id": "t1"}])

    @router.post("/api/things")
    def create_thing(req):
        req.note(name=req.body.get("name"))   # lands in /__requests
        return Response({"id": "t2"}, status=201)

    # A path with a variable tail: `router.prefix`, then read `req.rest`.
    # (An exact path never falls back to a prefix: `GET /api/memories/statistics`
    # therefore wins over `prefix("GET", "/api/memories/")` without ordering them.)
    @router.prefix("PUT", "/api/things/")
    def update_thing(req):
        return Response({"id": req.rest.split("/")[0]})

    @router.reset
    def fresh():
        STATE["things"] = []

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main(label="things")

    Routes are consulted BEFORE the shell's own, in registration order, and the
    first handler that returns a `Response` wins. Returning `None` falls through
    to the next route and finally to the shell — that is how a feature answers
    only the shape it cares about (see `immich_stub_recent.py`, which answers the
    two ordered bucket lists and leaves the plain timeline to the shell).

WHY IT IS COMMITTED
    The first stub of this harness lived in /tmp and a `rm -rf /tmp/*` destroyed
    it; only the test comments remembered it existed. Everything a scenario needs
    is in the repository: `python3 UITests/stubs/immich_stub_<feature>.py 8421`.

THE THUMBNAIL TRAP (already paid for twice)
    `png()` generates real 8×8 PNG bytes and NOTHING here may replace it with a
    hand-written literal. `AuthenticatedAsyncImage` decodes the body with
    ImageIO: an undecodable fixture (a pasted 1×1 JPEG) does not fail the app —
    it turns every screenshot of a grid into broken tiles while the app itself is
    correct. Worse, it survives its own fix: both image caches key on the URL
    (`ImageCache` in memory, `URLCache` on disk, the session is
    `returnCacheDataElseLoad`), so a warm simulator keeps replaying the bad body
    and the stub looks broken. Hence two rules: the bytes are generated
    (`png()`), served `Cache-Control: no-store`, and `STATE["thumbhash"]` is
    rotated by `/__reset` so a stale body can never be replayed across runs.

WHAT IS LOGGED
    Every non-`/__*` request, as
    `{"method": …, "path": …, "params": {name: value}, "body": {…}}`.
    `/__requests` serves that list, which is what a scenario asserts on:
    `req.note(**fields)` adds feature-specific fields to the entry (a POST's
    `assetIds`, a PUT's `isSaved`). A duplicated query parameter keeps its LAST
    value, and a blank one is kept as `""` so `orderBy=` is distinguishable from
    an absent `orderBy`.
