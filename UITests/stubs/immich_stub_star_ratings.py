"""Immich API stub for the star-rating scenario (`StarRatingsUITests`).

Thin on purpose: everything the app needs to boot, sign in, draw the timeline
and open a photo comes from `immich_stub_base` (the OAuth handshake, the server
config, `/api/users/me`, one day of timeline, real PNG thumbnails, the asset
DTO the info panel reads). This file adds the ONE route the feature owns — the
rating write — plus the one control route that makes the write's ANSWER
observable:

    python3 UITests/stubs/immich_stub_star_ratings.py 8421

    .omp/orchestration/uitest.sh <worktree> /tmp/star-ratings.uitest.log \\
        UITests/stubs/immich_stub_star_ratings.py StarRatingsUITests/test_starRatings

WHAT THE WIRE HAS TO SHOW, AND WHY EACH PART IS HERE
    `PATCH /api/assets/:id` is the whole feature. Three things are asserted on
    its body and on its answer, and each one needs this stub to be able to fail:

    1. `rating` is the only field written. The DTO the panel sends is
       `UpdateAssetDto`-shaped to a naive reader (`isFavorite`/`visibility`/…),
       and an update DTO reused for the rating would still carry `rating`.

    2. CLEARING sends `{"rating": null}` — the key PRESENT with a null value,
       never an omitted one. The server has no `0` (invalid since v3), so an
       omitted key reads as "no change" and the star would stay on the server
       while the bar reads empty: a silent desync. The two bodies are
       indistinguishable after decoding (`{}` and `{"rating": null}` both give
       `body.get("rating") is None`), so the KEY's presence is recorded
       separately by `req.note` — `/__requests` is where the scenario reads it.

    3. The panel shows what the SERVER answered, not what was tapped. A stub
       that echoed every write could not tell `rating = response.exifInfo?.rating`
       from `rating = sent`; `POST /control/rating-response` arms the next
       answer, the scenario taps 4 and requires the panel to read 3.
